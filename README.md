# Fruit Machine in JS

One of the Guardian Tech Tests (React Upgrade ... in progress!)

I wrote this while looking for my first job. It kinda made me cringe. I want to learn some React so I thought it would be quite a cool idea to re-write this in it. Then I can look back in a year and cringe at the app again.

I'm treating it like a CI upgrade.
I will upgrade it gradually and try and keep same testing framework and system design. (Where possible!)

Notes
======
difficulty in maintaining Jasmine with ES6.
